/**
 * @file
 * Header driver file for the media layer of Libuavcan v1 targeting
 * the NXP S32K14 family of automotive grade MCU's, running
 * CAN-FD at 4Mbit/s data phase and 1Mbit/s in nominal phase.
 *
 * @par Pre-processing macros that affect driver compilation:
 * @li @c LIBUAVCAN_S32K_RX_FIFO_LENGTH The number of messages per-interface that can be buffered
 *     from the receive ISR before the mesage is read on the main thread. This memory will be allocated
 *     in .bss by most linkers.
 * @li @c LIBUAVCAN_S32K_NO_TIME If defined as 1 then the driver will not provide correct receive timestamps
 *     and the select method will return @code Result::NotImplemented. This allows a firmware to skip
 *     implementing the @c libuavcan_media_s32k_get_monotonic_time_nanos_isr_safe method.
 * @li @c MCU_S32K14X This driver can be compiled for the MCU_S32K142, MCU_S32K146, MCU_S32K148
 * @li @c LIBUAVCAN_S32K_RDDRONE_BOARD_USED If defined as 1 then PORTE pins 10 and 11 will be controlled
 *     internally by the driver to enable the transceiver of the rddrone_uavcan node board.
 * @li @c LIBUAVCAN_S32K_WDREFRESH_WHILE_WAITING_FOR_FREEZE_MODE If defined as 1 then the driver will refresh
 *      the watchdog peripheral while waiting for the peripheral to enter freeze mode. Do not enable this if
 *      you use the window feature of the watchdog and this is not required if your watchdog timeout is >
 *      about 800 nominal CAN bit times. Freeze mode must be entered when starting an interface group.

/**
 * To use all the features of the S32K libuavcan media layer you must implement this method in your firmware. It
 * is used by interface groups and interfaces for all timekeeping including RX timestamping. It is defined as a C
 * method to allow sharing with other drivers written in C.
 *
 * This implementation expects a mirosecond-resolution timer. If your system cannot provide this simply up-sample
 * the time available to provide the correct units if not the correct resolution.
 *
 * @par Implementation Requirements:
 * @li The time returned must be monotonic. For a true 64-bit timer this is an intrinisic property since
 *     the rollover for 64-bits in microseconds will exceed the lifespan of the silicon the interfaces are running
 *     on. If implemented using a 32-bit timer (or less) other provisions must be made to prevent the returned
 *     value from decreasing.
 * @li The timer must be ISR-safe. The interface groups may invoke this method from CAN peripheral ISRs and from calls
 *     into methods on the  @c InterfaceGroup object.
 * @li For performance reasons, the method should not disable interrupts. Where using a chained timer, a simple strategy
 *     is to use optimistic reads of the high and low channels in a loop where the full 64-bit value is only returned
 *     once both reads can be made without either value changing.
 * @li The timer's accuracy is directly proportional to the immediacy of the returned timer value (latency) and the
 * consistency of the method's timing (jitter). If a cached time value updated by an ISR is used the latency between
 * updates may introduce jitter into the receive timestamps. If these timestamps are used for precision timekeeping then
 * this jitter may become unacceptable to higher layers. It is better to increase the amount of time spent in the call
 * if the value returned is closer to the actual timer value (i.e. more instructions between invoking the call and
 * obtaining the value do not create latency or jitter but variability in the number of instructions between the time
 * the value was captured and the method returning that value introduces jitter).
 *
 * @note
 * The @c LPIT timer in the S32K family of MCUs is, unfortunately, not well-suited for implementing this method
 * since the current value of its counters cannot be reliably read outside of an ISR.
