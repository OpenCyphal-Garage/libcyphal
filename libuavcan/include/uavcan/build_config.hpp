 * This definition contains the integer year number after which the standard was named:
 *  - 2003 for C++03
 *  - 2011 for C++11
 *
 * This config automatically sets according to the actual C++ standard used by the compiler.
 *
 * In C++03 mode the library has almost zero dependency on the C++ standard library, which allows
 * to use it on platforms with a very limited C++ support. On the other hand, C++11 mode requires
 * many parts of the standard library (e.g. <functional>), thus the user might want to force older
 * standard than used by the compiler, in which case this symbol can be overridden manually via
 * compiler flags.
