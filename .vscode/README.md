Visual Studio Code
====================================

> Note that libcyphal is a header-only library. This configuration and the associated documentation is for developers of libcyphal itself. If you are using libcyphal you probably won't benefit from this configuration but hey, thanks for using our software.

A lot of the configuration here was borrowed from the [PX4 firmware project](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/.vscode/). Thanks [PX4 peeps](https://www.dronecode.org/) and thank you [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) for this great open-source IDE.

See the [libcyphal dev guide](https://uavcan.org/libcyphal/_lib_dev_guide.html) for full details on setting up vscode for libcyphal liburary development.
