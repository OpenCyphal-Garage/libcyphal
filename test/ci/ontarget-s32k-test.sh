# | This script is one of the common set of commands run as
# | part of a continuous integration build pipeline.
# | These scrips are named using the following scheme:
# |
# |   [build_type]-[(optional)build_type qualifier]-[build|test|report|upload].sh
# |
# | Of course, libuavcan is a header-only distribution so
# | CI is used to verify and test rather than package and
# | deploy (i.e. There's really no 'I' going on).
# |
# | NOTE: You must have the environment variable NAIT_UART_DEVICE
# | set to the serial port you are using to monitor hardware
# | tests or supply this as the first argument to this script.
